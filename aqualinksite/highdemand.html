                        <h4>Pesto Pasta:</h4>

                        <h3>Sand Paper Fish</h3>
                        <p>Sandpaper fish, also known as filefish or 
                        leatherjacket, is a type of saltwater 
                        fish known for its mild and delicate flavor. The texture of the flesh is somewhat firm and slightly chewy. It's called 
                        "sandpaper fish" due to its rough, sandpaper-like skin.

                        <p>Sprinkle fresh herbs, like chopped parsley, dill, or chives, over the fish for a burst of freshness and color.

                        with additional flavors. Try marinades with ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, 
                        honey, and herbs to create a delicious and aromatic profile.</p>

                        <h4>Ways to Cook Red Emperor Fish to Perfection:</h4>
                            
                        <h4>Grilling:</h4> 
                        <p>Grilling red emperor fish is a fantastic way to 
                        bring out its natural flavors. Marinate the fish with a 
                        mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs. Grill it over medium-high heat, turning once, until the flesh flakes easily. The smoky char from the grill complements the sweet and nutty taste of the fish.
                        </p>    
                        <h4>Baking or Roasting:</h4> 
                        <p>Baking or roasting red emperor fish with a flavorful seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil is a simple yet delicious method. The gentle, even heat in the oven helps maintain the fish's moisture and tenderness. Consider topping it with sliced tomatoes, 
                        fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lemon before baking.
