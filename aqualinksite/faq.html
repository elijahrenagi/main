            <p>You can search for a reliable fish market in 
                your area by asking for recommendations from friends and family, 
                checking online reviews, or visiting your local seafood markets.

            <h5>Clear, Bright Eyes:</h5> 
            <p>Fresh fish have clear, bright, 
                and slightly bulging eyes. The eyes should not appear cloudy or sunken.</p>
            <h5>Moist and Shiny Skin:</h5> 
            <p>The fish's skin should be moist, 
                shiny, and glistening. It should 
                not be dry, dull, or discolored.
            </p>
            <h5>Firm Flesh:</h5> 
            <p>press the flesh with your finger; 
                it should feel firm and spring back. Avoid fish with soft or mushy flesh.
            </p>               
            <h5>Ocean-Like Smell:</h5> 
            <p>Fresh fish should have a mild, clean, 
                and slightly briny odor reminiscent of the ocean. It should 
                not have a strong or unpleasant fishy smell.
            </p>
            <h5>Red Gills (for some species):</h5>

            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <h4>How can I store my fish to keep it fresh?</h4>
                    <Section>
                        <div class="freshnes">
                            <img src="images/freshfishfrozen.jpg" alt="fresh fish images">
                        </div>
                    </Section>
            <p>Store fresh fish in the coldest part of your refrigerator, 
                ideally between 32째F (0째C) and 38째F (3째C). Keep it in an airtight 
                container or wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from 
                absorbing other odors. Consume it within a day or two for the best quality.
